###LetYourselfBeCreative###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This app serves as a sort of creativity prompt, based on the challenge posed
here. https://gbenard.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/what-makes-a-good-photograph-ii/

"I challenge you to do an exercise with uninteresting objects that you have at home: a thread, a staple and a piece of printing paper. You can do an uninteresting photo of the thread and the staple over the white paper… or you can be creative and play with the light, create a sculpture, an installation, different shades, different angles… create different messages. Try it. Try to do 7 completely different approaches to the same objects. And see the result."

It expands on that, giving many different sets of uninteresting items to
experiment with. You can long press an item to see others' photos of that
same item to gain further inspiration.

Star a triad of words to store it for later so you can revisit it.
